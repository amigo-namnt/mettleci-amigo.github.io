# Why MettleCI?

# Introduction

Data Migrators' MettleCI dramatically increases the quality of DataStage jobs, and the speed with which those jobs can be promoted through your quality assurance processes into production. It enables an order-of-magnitude increase in your delivery cadence and elevates you and your stakeholders' trust in the reliability of the DataStage code delivered by your team. MettleCI enables a significant reduction in your time to delivery through the complete automation of common software delivery processes, including unit testing, code review, and deployment.

MettleCI is the embodiment of the [shift-left testing philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) brought to the Information Server landscape. By testing early and often, risk is identified and addressed earlier in the delivery lifecycle, reducing both the time and cost involved in delivering a quality DataStage solution.

With MettleCI your DataStage team no longer needs to lag behind their digital counterparts in the adoption of modern software delivery practices and can adopt true DevOps/DataOps practices with the minimum effort.
