| **Rule name** | DataStage Flow Designer Stages |
| **Parallel Job** | Yes |
| **Server Job** | Yes |
| **Job Sequence** | \-  |
| **Description** | Lists the stages that are not yet supported by IBM Data Flow Designer |

# Description

For the Upgrade scenario, it will be useful in the future to know which jobs can be fully supported using Data Flow Designer. Each job that 'fails' this rule needs the standard DataStage Client tier available in order to be maintained.

# Usage

As new stages become supported, change **No** in the list to **Yes**.

# Actions

None. This is a legacy Compliance Rule (due to future retirement) which has been superseded by [CP4D Unsupported Stages](../mettleci-compliance-rules-reference/cp4d-unsupported-stages.md).
