# Default Naming

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Rule name** | Default Naming |
| **Parallel Job** | Yes |
| **Server Job** | Yes |
| **Job Sequence** | Yes |
| **Description** | Default Stage Names for Parallel Jobs, Server Jobs, and Job Sequences |

# Description

Stages should be given meaningful names, to improve readability and reduce bug-fixing effort. The use of default (DataStage-supplied) names (e.g. `Link123`) suggests that jobs might possibly be *not quite finished*.

# Actions

Ensure that all Jobs, Sequences, Stages, and Links are given user-chosen names (not just defaults) which align with your [naming standards](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/706215949/Compliance+Default+Asset+Naming+Standards#Parallel-Job-Stages).
