# Common Unit Testing Patterns

Most DataStage jobs can be tested via MettleCIâ€™s Unit Testing function simply by replacing input and output stages. However, some job designs - while commonplace - will necessitate a more advanced Unit Testing configuration. The sections below outline MettleCI Unit Test Spec patterns that best match these job designs.
