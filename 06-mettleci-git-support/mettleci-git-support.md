# MettleCI Git Support

A Git repository is effectively a filesystem directory managed by a software system ('Git') which tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the files in that filesystem (known as a ‘Git project’). Your files are stored in a directory called `.git` , also known as the repository folder.
