# Git and MettleCI

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

> [!INFO]
> ## **Git ≠ GitHub**
> We often see the terms **Git** and **GitHub** being used interchangeably, and it’s important to understand that Git and GitHub are very different things.
> **Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
> **GitHub** is a commercial hosting service owned by Microsoft that provides a Git repositories as a SaaS solution. Microsoft also provide **GitHub Enterprise** which is a service equivalent to the SaaS offering which is installed on-premises in a customer’s data center. See [our page on GitHub integration](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/741376173/GitHub).
> Similarly, **GitLab** ([described here](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/741244932/GitLab)) is another commercial offering built on top of Git.
> See [this page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpISo9TNjfU) for a description of the differences between Git and GitHub.
