Atlassian Corporation is an Australian enterprise software multinational that develops products for software development, project management, and content management. It is best known for its issue tracking application Jira, and its team collaboration and wiki product Confluence. Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems. Bamboo is a continuous integration and continuous deployment server developed by Atlassian.

### Ways MettleCI can integrate with Atlassian
