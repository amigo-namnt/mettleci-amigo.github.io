Azure DevOps Server (formerly Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team System) is a Microsoft product that provides version control (either with Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) or Git), reporting, requirements management, project management (for both agile software development and waterfall teams), automated builds, lab management, testing and release management capabilities. It covers the entire application lifecycle, and enables DevOps capabilities.

MettleCI is compatible with bothâ€¦

*   **Azure DevOps Server**, collaboration software for software development formerly known as Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team System, and
    
*   **Azure DevOps Services**, cloud service for software development formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services, Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Service Preview
