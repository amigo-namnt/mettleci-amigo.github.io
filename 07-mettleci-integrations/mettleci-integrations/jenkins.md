Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports a number of version control tools, including Git, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven, and sbt-based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.

### Ways MettleCI can integrate with Jenkins

*   Enable CI/CD Jenkins DevOps Pipelines for Information Server via the [MettleCI Command Line Interface](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/408354840/MettleCI+CLI+Operating+Modes)
    
*   Provide Compliance, Unit Test, and Integration Test results as Jenkins-compatible [JUnit test reports](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/junit/#)
