# A Workbench update doesn't appear to have installed

# Symptom

Iâ€™ve installed a new version of the MettleCI Workbench but when my browser still seems to be showing me the old version.

# Solution

Your browser may be caching an old version of the Workbench application which need to be flushed before the updated functionality becomes available: You can do this by [force refreshing your browser](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/2110357519/Force+Refreshing+your+Browser).
