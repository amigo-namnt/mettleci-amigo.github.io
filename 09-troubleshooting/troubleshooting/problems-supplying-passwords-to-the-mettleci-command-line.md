# Problems supplying passwords to the MettleCI Command Line

# Problem

Sometimes you may find that passing passwords which contain special characters (i.e. punctuation characters) to the MettleCI Command Line causes unexpected errors when your command shell attempts to parse those parameters.

# Solution

See the documentation section on [using a password containing special characters](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/408354840/MettleCI+Command+Line+Interface#Use-a-password-containing-special-characters).
