# Shared Container image previews not available in Atlassian Bitbucket

# Environment

Standalone (non-Cloud Pak) DataStage installation, Atlassian Bitbucket.

# Problem

When committing a a Shared Container to a Git repository which supports DataStage image previews (currently limited to Atlassian Bitbucket) no images of the Shared Containerâ€™s design are created. It works fine for Jobs and Sequences, but not for Shared Containers.

# Reason

The underlying IBM components upon which MettleCI relies to generate those previews do not support generating previews of Shared Containers.

# Solution

There are currently no workarounds for this issue.
