# Purchasing MettleCI

MettleCI can currently be licensed in three ways:

## Directly from Data Migrators

Customers seeking to use MettleCI’s capabilities to dramatically increase their ongoing, business-as-usual activities can license MettleCI on an [annual subscription](https://datamigrators.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MCIDOC/pages/271187985/What+is+the+MettleCI+Licensing+Model) basis. This subscription is purchased directly from Data Migrators, and renewed directly with Data Migrators each year. In some territories, MettleCI can also be purchased through a network of trusted resellers.

In either case, contact your Data Migrators representative to find out more.

## From IBM as part of a Cloud Pak entitlement

Customers purchasing a DataStage cartridge as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data may be entitled to MettleCI. Please speak to your IBM representative for more details.

## From IBM as part of a MettleCI-related services engagement (e.g., a Rapid DataStage Upgrade)

Customers can gain access to MettleCI as part of a growing suite of MettleCI services engagements. Customers wanting to use MettleCI exclusively to migrate a legacy DataStage solution to a new platform, for example, can access MettleCI's capabilities by purchasing a monthly subscription to an IBM [Rapid DataStage Upgrade](http://rapiddatastageupgrade.com/) Services offering. Contact your IBM sales representative to find out more.
