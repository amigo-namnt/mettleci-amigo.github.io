# Support Policy

1.  Data Migrators will provide the support services for the Software in accordance with the Order and this Agreement provided you have paid all fees due. Support will be provided at the Support Level and during the support term specified in the Order. Support Levels may be modified by Data Migrators from time to time to reflect process improvements or changing practices provided however that the modification has no substantial impact on the use of the Software by you.
    
2.  The Standard Support Level for Software includes:
    
    1.  Self-help resources in the form of Data Migrators-hosted wiki pages, covering generic instructions for software installation, configuration, end-use and trouble-shooting, as well as customer-specific equivalents if created as a result of consulting work associated with the licensed Software.
        
    2.  A support portal in the form of an online issue management system dedicated to your installed Software instance and accessible by up to two primary contacts from your organisation.
        
    3.  Next-business day response from engineers who have deep experience of both developing and deploying the licensed software.
        
    4.  A minimum of quarterly contact with two primary contacts from your company to ensure on-going familiarity with your DataStage platform and how your organisation is using MettleCI .
        
    5.  Access to New Releases, if and when available.
        
3.  You may use any New Releases that we provide to you during a valid support term in the same way that you use the existing Software, and New Releases are included in the definition of Software in that case. If you purchase any Software through a Reseller, then the Reseller will be responsible and not Data Migrators for providing support services to you for the Software in accordance with the Order with the Reseller.
    
4.  Custom Support Levels may be agreed between Data Migrators and your organisation and must be specified in an Order, an addendum to the Software License Agreement signed by both parties or as part of a separate statement of work.
    
5.  We will deliver Support services according to the relevant Support Level subject to reasonable access to your relevant personnel and your provision of information relevant to the issue as requested by us, including via live web conference facilities.
    
6.  Standard Support Level severity levels and our corresponding target lead times are defined in the following table.
